    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</li>
        <li>¼ cup dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>2 cups honey</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>
        <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>
        <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with 
            the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, 
            and let sit a few minutes before serving.</li>
