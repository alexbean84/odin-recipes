    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Hard boiled eggs are great food to have on hand as their uses are so versatile. 
        Not only are they super delicious on their own, but they are great in sandwiches,
        chopped up on salads and the foundation for all devilled eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Add the eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, 
            and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water 
            or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
