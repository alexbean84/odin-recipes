# odin-recipes
Hello! I made this project in order to showcase my HTML skills
that I acquired quite recently. This is a website that consists of an
index page and three other webpages, each representing a different recipe.

This is Project: Recipes from The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

My Project live: https://alexbean84.github.io/odin-recipes/

GitHub Code Files: https://github.com/alexbean84/odin-recipes

What I learned:
- How to use elements and tags
- How to accurately write the HTML boilerplate
- How to properly work with text
- How to make lists
- How to use links and images
